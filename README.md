# PHP-login-MVC
A simple web page with a log-in and register page, im using pdo to access data, currently i am separating the various parts of the code, in the end it should be in MVC standard (view, controller, router(MainController used to redirect to all other files), model)


Currently some versions are not working because of broken page links and the absence of the Main Controller with all the specific controllers
